      ELBOW UP!-
When hitting the ball, the elbow of your left arm (right arm for lefthanders) should be nice and high. This will help you to avoid hitting the ball into the air and popping small catches to the bowler and close in fielders. If youâ€™re not quite to the pitch of the ball, offer a dead bat. Let the ball come onto the bat rather than following through with the shot.</p>
